# EcoGrow AI: Plant Resiliency Research

Welcome to the EcoGrow AI repository focused on understanding and analyzing plant resiliency under various adverse climate conditions. This repository contains the experimental setup, data collection methods, analysis tools, and algorithms for calculating plant resilience using biomass measurements.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to quantify plant resiliency by measuring the ability of plants to retain biomass when exposed to adverse climate conditions. This project will help determine which plants are more resistant to environmental stressors such as drought, waterlogging, and extreme temperatures.

## Repository Structure

•	**/experiments/**
•	Contains descriptions of experimental setups for various climate conditions.

•	**/data/**
•	The folder for storing collected experimental data.

•	**/scripts/**
•	Contains Python scripts for data analysis, statistical testing, and visualization.

•	**/docs/**
•	Documentation for the resiliency scoring algorithm, experimental protocols, and statistical methods used.


### Features
•	Experimental Protocols: Detailed methods for setting up and running plant resiliency experiments.

•	Data Collection: Instructions on how to collect, record, and organize biomass data.

•	Resiliency Scoring Algorithm: Algorithm to compute the Resiliency Score based on the percentage of biomass retained under adverse conditions.

•	Statistical Tools: Integrated statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to analyze experimental data.

•	Visualization Tools: Pre-built scripts to visualize experimental results in graphs, making data interpretation easy.
